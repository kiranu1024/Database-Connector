[![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/mysql/mysql-connector-j.svg?color=5382a1)](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/tree/release/8.0/src) [![License: GPLv2 with FOSS exception](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv2_with_FOSS_exception-c30014.svg)](LICENSE) [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/mysql/mysql-connector-java.svg)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java)

MySQL provides connectivity for client applications developed in the Java programming language with MySQL Connector/J, a driver that implements the [Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/) and also [MySQL X DevAPI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/).

MySQL Connector/J 8.0 is a JDBC Type 4 driver that is compatible with the [JDBC 4.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/) specification. The Type 4 designation means that the driver is a pure Java implementation of the MySQL protocol and does not rely on the MySQL client libraries.

The driver also contains an implementation of [MySQL X DevAPI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/), an Application Programming Interface for working with [MySQL as a Document Store](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/document-store.html) through CRUD-based, NoSQL operations.

For detailed information, please visit the official [MySQL Connector/J documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/).
